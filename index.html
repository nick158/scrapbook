					<h1>'Great Pacific Garbage Patch' researchers devastated by sight</h1>
						<p>Far away from California's coast, where the Pacific Ocean currents swirl, the blue of the sea was replaced by fishing nets, buckets, buoys, laundry baskets and unidentifiable pieces of plastic that floated past the Ocean Star, a ship carrying a team of scientists and volunteers gathering data on plastic garbage.</p> 
<p>"We were surrounded by an endless layer of garbage," sad Serena Cunsolo, an Italian marine biologist who works for The Ocean Cleanup. "It was devastating to see."</p> 
<p>Cunsolo, 28, was one of a team of 15 researchers and volunteers aboard the Ocean Starr who a month ago set out from San Francisco to study the plastic waste as part of the "Mega Expedition," a major step in the organization's effort to eventually clean up what's known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.</p> 
						<p>The 171-foot mother ship returned on Sunday to San Francisco, carrying massive white bags filled with plastic garbage along with two sailing boats with volunteers who helped collect the garbage samples.</p>

							<h1>Summary</h1>
							<p>
							The terms which are relevant to “Chapter 1: Scarcity & Decision Making”’, are closely connected to the article on the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. The large amounts of plastic in the Garbage Patch are likely a result of <b>psychological wants</b>, the desiring of <b>goods</b> not essential to life. People demand low-cost goods to satisfy their psychological wants. The size of the Garbage Patch indicates that there is a lower <b>opportunity cost</b> for throwing away these plastic goods as compared to recycling them. The higher opportunity cost for recycling poses a sustainability issue as Earth’s <b>natural resources</b> slowly run out.

							<h1>Business Elite See Income Inequality as a Threat to Business</h1>
						<p>The income gap is concerning even those at the very top of the economic ladder, a new study shows.</p>
						<p>A recent survey of Harvard Business School alumni shows that they are overall optimistic about U.S. business performance in the global economy. </p>
						<p>In their view, barriers to entrepreneurship are lower compared to other countries and entrepreneurship is more accessible in America today than it was a decade ago, according to Harvard Business School's latest survey on U.S. competitiveness.
						</p>
						<p>Despite this sentiment, they're concerned that their businesses stand to suffer from the lack of shared prosperity in the U.S.</p>
						<p>More than 70 percent of respondents say the lack of shared prosperity is a problem for their business--not just a social issue. Two thirds of respondents consider resolving rising inequality and middle-class stagnation a higher priority than boosting overall economic growth</p>

							<h1>Summary</h1>
							<p>
							This article has a strong relationship between the concepts discussed in ‘Chapter 2: National Decision Making.’USA is mainly a <b>market economy</b>, which is founded on the principles of <b>profit</b> and innovation. Unlike a <b>command or mixed economy</b>, it is the uncoordinated actions of buyers and sellers to decide which goods and services are produced. The article’s main concern is that the income inequality caused by the market economy in the USA may be creating barriers for individuals looking to innovate and create businesses in the US economy.

					<h1>Oil patch takes aim at R&D spending to make way for more cuts</h1>
						<p>Cash-starved oil sands companies are eyeing fresh cuts to research and development budgets – a sign that today’s depressed crude prices could hamper the innovation that analysts say is needed to lower production costs in the notoriously expensive sector.</p> 
<p>Some of the industry’s biggest producers, including Cenovus Energy Inc. and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., are putting spending on technology development under the microscope even as they seek cheaper ways to wring crude from Alberta.</p> 
<p>It’s the latest indication that executives don’t expect prices to return to triple-digit levels any time soon. A Cenovus executive said Tuesday the company was now stress-testing its balance sheet against $50 (U.S.) crude to the end of 2017, hinting at more pain to come.</p> 
						<p>Companies have so far scrapped billions of dollars’ worth of expansion projects, frozen salaries, and eliminated thousands of jobs to shore up finances amid the year-long rout.</p>

							<h1>Summary</h1>
							<p>
							This article is discusses several topics which are relevant to key terms in ‘Chapter 3: Productive Resources’.The prices of the <b>natural resource</b>, resources which occur in nature, oil has dropped significantly. The drop in oil price is affecting the budget decisions of Canadian oil companies operating in the Canadian oil sands who are engaged in this <b>primary industry</b>. These companies are trying to allocate their <b>productive resources</b> so that they can outlast the downturn in oil prices, oftentimes by closing oil wells. Some companies are choosing to cut back on their R&D budget while others are choosing to cut the cost of <b>human resources</b> by laying off workers.

							<h1>Think Like Uber: How to Validate Demand and Supply Before You Build</h1>
						<p>At a $50 billion valuation, Uber is now valued higher than 80 percent of the S&P 500. With that kind of success, it's no surprise that a legion of startup minds are racing to cash in on the same approach. Who among us doesn't want to be the founder of the next Uber? We are seeing the "Uberization" of the American economy.</p>
						<p>My company, Trustify, gives consumers access to vetted, experienced private investigators with the touch of a button, in the same way that Uber puts ride-seekers in touch with drivers. I've seen what works and what doesn't in this model, especially if you're trying to disrupt an established market. Before you speak to investors, build a product or hire a team, you must first validate demand and the labor force. </p>
						<p>Uber did not invent the concept of aggregating disparate supply and demand to create a business. People have been creating marketplaces to buy and sell products and services since the Stone Age. But Uber stands out because they're loud, disruptive and lean -- leveraging cheap and accessible technology at scale</p>

							<h1>Summary</h1>
							<p>
							This article is a classic case study of how <b>supply</b> and <b>demand</b> can affect the economy. The author applies the principles of supply and demand to startup companies such as Uber, which essentially connects freelance drivers to demanding consumers. For startups looking to emulate Uber, the author cautions that these business find a niche <b>market</b> where there is both <b>inelastic demand</b> for their service and freelance suppliers to provide that service. One key point worth noting is that for many businesses trying to emulate Uber, they pick a niche which does not have enough demand. This results in a surplus of supply which ultimately results in the failure of the business.

					<h1>Wall Report on telecom shows cellphone plans got more expensive this year</h1>
						<p>Canadians are still paying among the highest prices in the industrialized world for cellular service, but unlimited packages got a little bit cheaper last year, according to a report commissioned by Canada's telecom regulator.
						</p> 
						<p>
	The Wall Report, first published in 2005 by Ottawa-based consultancy Wall Communications Inc. published its latest findings on Canada's telecom industry on Thursday, at the request of the CRTC.
						</p> 
						<p>
	The report looks at the variety of telecom services on offer to Canadians, and compares them with offerings in the U.S., the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Australia and Japan.
						</p> 
						<p>It's the eighth version of the Wall report and on the whole, this year's version paints a picture of a telecom market that is generally more expensive than last year.

							<h1>Summary</h1>
							<p>
								This article supports the theory of a spectrum of markets. In Canada, there were 3 major phone companies, Bell, Rogers, and Fido which dominated the industry. This resulted in an <b>oligopoly</b>. Having only 3 companies in the industry and high <b>barriers to entry</b> resulted in the average monthly price of a mobile plan to be close to $15 higher than in other countries. However many smaller competitors have joined the mobile market such as WIND Mobile and Mobilicity. This results in increased <b>competition</b>, which has decreased prices for consumers.

							<h1>Bernie Sanders Explains How Taxing The Rich Will Pay For His Policies</h1>
						<p>Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is adamant that only wealthy Americans will need to pay higher taxes to fund his proposals for expanding government social programs.</p>
						<p>Bill Maher, who interviewed Sanders on HBO’s “Real Time” on Friday night, pressed Sanders on the point.
						</p>
						<p>“Now this has been studied, the amount of tax revenue we would get just from taxing the people who I think your fans think you’re talking about -- the people who own a yacht -- does not come close to covering what you want to pay for,” Maher argued.
						</p>
						<p>
						“Not true, not true,” the Democratic presidential hopeful responded.
						</p>
						<p>
						Sanders then went through the largest items on his policy agenda -- Medicare for all; free college tuition at public institutions; higher Social Security benefits; and free child care -- and explained how each of them would only require asking more of wealthy Americans.

							<h1>Summary</h1>
							<p>
							The article discusses how potential Democrat candidate Bernie Sanders would use the taxes of the rich to fund social programs such as free education and healthcare. In essence, Sander’s suggestion is a method to <b>redistribute</b> the <b>wealth</b> in the USA, where <b>income inequality</b> runs rampant. By funding free health care, education, and better Social Security, this allows equal opportunities for American citizens who are living below the <b>L.I.C.O</b>. If implemented, such actions would benefit the economy as it would create a larger middle class with higher discretionary income to purchase goods from businesses.

					<h1>Ontario elementary teachers’ union mulls one-day rotating strikes</h1>
						<p>Ontario elementary teachers’ union leaders, angry about a tell-all news release from a bargaining partner, are debating whether to begin the one-day rotating strikes they threatened last month.
						</p> 
<p>“We’re going to have to make some significant decisions tonight or tomorrow morning,” Sam Hammond, president of the Elementary Teachers’ Federation of Ontario, said late Wednesday afternoon.
						</p> 
<p>If the one-day strikes do begin, there’s no telling how much warning parents would receive, Mr. Hammond said. “I’m not going to give anyone guarantees.”.</p> 
						<p>Mr. Hammond said bargaining has been jeopardized by a Wednesday afternoon news release from the Ontario Public School Boards Association that detailed how much progress has been made in contract talks with ETFO, and what is left to do.</p>

							<h1>Summary</h1>
							<p>
							This article documents the contract negotiations between elementary school teachers and the Ministry of Education in Ontario. The <b>labour union</b> and other parties have yet to agree on matters such as sick leave and teacher benefits. ETFO is using <b>collective bargaining</b> in order to negotiate these terms, and as part of the process threatens <b>rotating strikes</b> for elementary school teachers. Teachers have used these tactics successfully before to gain deals such as a <b>closed shop</b> workplace. This article effectively demonstrates the power of unions when negotiating contracts and improving conditions for their workers.

							<h1>Hacking Health drives healthcare into 21st century with new accelerator</h1>
						<p>Stepping into an old Montreal hospital often feels like stepping into the 1980s.</p>
						<p>Dismal paint jobs, flickering fluorescent lights and chipped melamine everywhere, not to mention the malfunctioning take-a-number dispensers and a two-hour wait to get a blood test from a nurse — hospitals here are often the last place you’d associate the word “innovation” with.
						</p>
						<p>But Luc Sirois and his squad of Hacking Health volunteers are looking to change that perception by giving hospitals an infusion of the entrepreneurial spirit.
						</p>
						<p>
						“Someone (working at the hospital) has a new idea. Who do they go see? Whose job includes receiving a new idea as part of their job description? Today, no one,” said Sirois, the co-founder and leader of Hacking Health.
						</p>
						<p>
						“You have to help the hospital understand how to transform itself, how to go from those standard administrative processes to creating new ways for ideas to enter the hospital.”
						</p>
						<p>Montreal-born Hacking Health is trying to do just that.</p>

					<h1>Tech Bubble Pops: Dropbox Warned It Can't IPO At Its "Private Valuation</h1>
						<p>While the full story of the unprecedented collapse of Theranos, its $9 billion "valuation", and its "wunderkind" founder Elizabeth Holmes has yet to be written, many are already wondering if this will be the catalyst that exposes just how naked the startup unicorn emperors have been all along.</p> 
<p>Luckily, we don't have to wait that long: according to the WSJ, the second tech bubble, one which has seen nearly 200 tech "unicorns" rising out of the ZIRP ashes in the past few years and promptly attaining valuations of over $1 billion, is bursting.</p> 
<p>Take IPO-hopeful Dropbox.com. Back in January 2014, TechCrunch wrote the following when the company was revealed to have just hit its $10 billion valuation round:</p> 
						<p>
Dropbox has raised a massive $250 million funding round, valuing the company at $10 billion according to the Wall Street Journal. The new funding round is led by a BlackRock fund, according to the WSJ, which cites “two people familiar with the deal” as the source of the report.</p>

							<h1>Summary</h1>
							<p>
This article discusses an issue with technology startups who are <b>private corporations</b>. These private corporations raise <b>capital</b> by giving a few investors <b>equity</b>  in their company. While this capital is needed for growth, an issue has arisen where the valuations of these private technology companies is higher than what public investors would pay on the <b>stock exchange</b>. What this results in is essentially a rebalancing of the demand and supply curves back towards an equilibrium point. Previously there was a surplus of demand for technology companies, but currently investors are unwilling to pay such exorbitant prices for shares. This results in a lowering of corporation valuations.

							<h1>Canadians are on a big-ticket shopping spree, retail data shows</h1>
						<p>Canadian consumers continue to snap up big-ticket items such as vehicles and furniture, providing a powerful jolt to an economy desperately in need of one as other areas (like low oil prices) drag on momentum.</p>
						<p>Statistics Canada said Thursday retail sales jumped more than expected in August – the fourth month in a row sales have ticked higher, despite persistent concerns among economy watchers about the affect sliding prices for oil and other commodities will have on consumers’ pocketbooks (by way of jobs and incomes, etc.).
						</p>
						<p>“Retail sales continued their recent ascent in August,” Brian DePratto, an economist at TD Bank said. Low borrowing rates and lower gasoline prices provided “ key supports” to spending, he said, while the federal handout to families (the Universal Child Care Benefit) in late July, likely also provided some lift.
						</p>
						<p>
						Here’s five things consumers should know about the latest retail sales figures:

							<h1>Summary</h1>
							<p>
							This article discusses the continued increase in Canadian <b>consumption</b>, as indicated by Statistics Canada. One reason outlined in the article would be low interest rates, which increases the use of consumer <b>credit</b> as it becomes cheaper to use instruments such as credit cards. The concern is that this increase in consumption comes at the cost of increased <b>consumer debt</b> which negatively impacts the <b>savings</b>  of consumers. Savings are an important factor in personal finances as in the future, savings allow one to retire with enough money to get through one’s “golden years”.

					<h1>Liberal fiscal plan outlines $146.5B in spending, tax cuts over next 4 years</h1>
						<p>The federal Liberals say they can add almost $146.5 billion in new government spending and tax cuts over the next four years, and still bring the budget back to balance with a surplus of about $1 billion by the end of a four-year mandate.</p> 
<p>The party's most prominent financial lieutenants released the full costing of the Liberal campaign platform Saturday, outlining the billions in new spending and revenues that would be in store for the next four years should a Liberal government be elected on Oct. 19.</p> 
<p>To get to the surplus, the Liberals plan to find billions in savings from eliminating a number of tax breaks, cutting back on government spending and cracking down on tax evasion. The measures include reviewing and cutting many programs introduced by the Conservatives, where they say they expect to find $3 billion in savings by 2020.</p> 
						<p>"Nothing is totally off the table," said candidate John McCallum.</p>

							<p>
							Prime minister Justin Trudeau has promised increased <b>government expenditures</b> on infrastructure and other <b>public goods</b>. This brings into question which form of <b>government revenue</b>  will be used in order to finance these expenditures, as such high expenditures would result in massive debt. The one proposed would be the using federal revenue from  higher income taxes on the wealthy and the slashing of certain government social programs. The rationale behind this spending program would be that it helps to <b>distribute</b> wealth, and create jobs which help towards Canada’s goal of full employment.

							<h1>Bank of Canada: Negative rates lift bar on changing inflation target</h1>
						<p>The Bank of Canada's new estimation that it could take interest rates into negative territory if needed makes the bar even higher for changing the central bank's existing 2 percent inflation target, Governor Stephen Poloz told Reuters on Friday.</p>
						<p>The central bank and the Canadian government are due to renew the bank's five-year inflation-targeting mandate by the end of next year.
						</p>
						<p>The bank had previously estimated that it could not cut rates lower than 0.25 percent but it now believes its benchmark interest rate could go as low as minus 0.5 percent. It currently stands at 0.5 percent after two rate cuts this year.
						</p>
						<p>
						Poloz said earlier this month that current circumstances did not warrant going to negative rates but that the ability to do so gave the central bank more room for maneuver.
						</p>
						<p>
						He noted on Friday that the lower rate threshold "shifts the argument" around the inflation target.

							The article discusses how the Bank of Canada, Canada’s <b>central bank</b> could potentially send interest rates into negative territory. If the Bank of Canada chose to do so, it is highly likely that through <b>moral suasion</b> other Canadian banks such as TD, BMO, and RBC would follow suite and lower their <b>prime lending rates</b>. By lowering interest rates the BoC is implementing an <b>expansionary monetary policy</b> in hopes of boosting consumer spending and increasing inflation.

					<h1>Alberta's Unemployment Crisis Has No Quick Fix: Federal Employment Minister</h1>
						<p>Canada's employment minister says there is no short-term fix for Alberta's growing unemployment rate.</p> 
<p>MaryAnn Mihychuk met with Calgary business, municipal and economic leaders Monday to address economic difficulties facing the province.</p> 
<p>She said there's no magic wand the federal government can wave to undo the impact of low oil prices, which have led to 40,000 job losses in the energy sector.</p> 
						<p>"We understand the crisis here in Alberta. It's not only here. This is the most dramatic, but it's also impacting Saskatchewan, Manitoba and B.C.,'' Mihychuk said.</p>
						<p>One of the first things the federal Liberal government intends to do is move ahead with cash for infrastructure projects and there is likely to be funding in the upcoming federal budget, she said.</p>

							<h1>Summary</h1>
							<p>
							Alberta is a province which relies heavily on the oil industry to provide jobs and bring wealth into the province. Low oil prices have led to significant job losses of over 40,000 jobs, and spike in <b>unemployment rates</b>. As oil is a commodity which has fluctuating prices, the recent downturn in oil prices and subsequent unemployment mean that Alberta is a victim of <b>cyclical unemployment</b>. To be more specific Alberta is currently in a <b>trough</b>, or a low point in the business cycle. The article discusses that while the government’s <b>fiscal policy</b> of infrastructure spending could help, ultimately there is no “short term fix” for the unemployment problem in Alberta.

							<h1>Banks are seriously discussing negative interest rates for normal people's savings</h1>
						<p>The concept of earning interest on money in the bank is so deeply ingrained into economic life that few people even know that the opposite can happen too: Banks can take a percentage of cash from your account in the form of negative interest rates, under certain conditions.</p>
						<p>Normally, this doesn't happen. Banks want your cash, and pay you interest on it, because the more deposits they have, the more they can lend it to others who pay them even more on their investments.
						</p>
						<p>But interest rates in Europe are so close to zero — and economic activity is so sluggish — that some central bankers are seriously discussing whether they should drive interest rates into negative territory in the future, as a sort of economic punishment for not spending money. The theory is that if you are deterred from keeping cash in the bank you'll withdraw it and spend some of it, thus creating economic growth.
						</p>
						<p>
						Europe's central banks and the US Federal Reserve have kept interest rates near zero for years now in the hopes of making money cheap to borrow.

							<h1>Summary</h1>
							<p>
							Moderate <b>inflation</b> is helpful to the economy as it helps debtors to manage debt, businesses to adjust wages, and countries to adjust their currency. The articles discusses the threat of low inflation in economies around the world, otherwise known as <b>deflation</b>. One solution discussed by central banks and governments is the <b>monetary policy</b> of negative interest rates.  This policy aims to increase inflation by encouraging consumers to spend money in the economy as money left in the bank will decrease with negative rates. This follows the theory of <b>demand-pull inflation</b> as consumers are now willing to spend more money on goods and raise prices.

					<h1>Africa: Climate Change, Africa and the Way Forward</h1>
						<p>The Earth's climate has never been completely static and it has changed due to natural and human causes at different times.</p> 
<p>Global warming and the climate changes seen today are being caused by the increase of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gas emissions.</p> 
<p>The impact of these shifts have an impact on all life-forms on our planet including on their sources of food and water. Current impacts that are already being observed are desertification, rising sea-levels as well as stronger extreme weather events like hurricanes and cyclones, and nowadays El Niño in some parts of Africa.</p> 
						<p>When a new global treaty on climate change is due, African leaders face competing priorities. Already suffering from the effects of climate change, they naturally support efforts to minimize the emissions of global greenhouse gases. On the other hand, they urgently need power to boost and transform their economies. While the effects are caused mainly by developed countries, the harm is mostly on developing countries which are contributing least to the threat.</p>

							<h1>Summary</h1>
							<p>
							Climate change is a matter of economic growth. As Earth continues to warm, African nations will be the most adversely affected. One climate matter that comes to mind is droughts. In Africa, subsistence farming is common practice and is negatively affected by drought. For <b>economic growth</b> to occur, there must be <b>specialization</b>, and when it becomes harder to meet one’s basic needs, it becomes very difficult to specialize. Thankfully, there is still hope. One opportunity for Africa lies in the <b>increased capital</b> that countries such as the US are providing in order to fund projects in Africa. This presents an opportunity for economic growth as this capital allows Africa to innovate and create <b>technology</b> that creates jobs and drives growth. One example? Solar lights.

							<h1>TPP an economic opportunity, not a guarantee</h1>
						<p>The recent announcement of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free-trade deal is one more confirmation of the importance of international trade for Canada and I anticipate that the new Liberal government of Justin Trudeau will endorse it. But it’s important to realize the TPP is simply an economic opportunity. It’s not a guarantee of economic success.</p>
						<p>It was international trade in 1497 that started the economic heartbeat of the landmass that would become Canada. And international trade has nurtured Canada as one of the most prosperous countries in the world.
						</p>
						<p>International trade is an important contributor to Canada’s economic growth, business vitality, employment creation and the standard of living of its citizens. Canada’s domestic population is far too small by itself to sustain the standard of living to which we have become accustomed. International trade is the trump card that helps us create a larger market, through exporting and outreach.
						</p>
						<p>
						The TPP consists of 12 countries: Brunei, Chile, New Zealand, Singapore, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan, Vietnam, Australia, Peru and Malaysia. It embraces the biggest trade zone in the world.

							<h1>Summary</h1>
							<p>
							The TPP is a proposed <b>free-trade</b> agreement between countries lying on the Pacific Rim. The TPP would abolish protective tariffs on many products such as dairy, meat, and automobiles. Unions and companies in several countries oppose tariff cuts as it may result in the loss of local jobs to foreign corporations. The author argues that the TPP will increase prosperity in Canada as new <b>export</b> markets have opened. Yet, the author notes that Canada’s success lies in its ability to innovate and compete against international products. Many countries have an <b>absolute advantage</b> over Canada in certain industries such as the production of wool. To succeed in international markets Canadian businesses must use their <b>comparative advantage</b> in order to take full advantage of the TPP.

							<ul class="terms">
								<li><b>Free Trade:</b> international trade that takes place without the obstacles of tariffs or other barriers to the unhindered movement of goods and services between countries.</li>
								<li><b>Export:</b> goods and services that are produced in one country and are then shipped to or sold in another country.
</li>
								<li><b>Absolute Advantage:</b> the ability of one person, region, or country to produce a good or a service at a cost lower than a competitor's. Ex. It is possible for USA to produce more oranges than Canada because of its climate, and very difficult to do so in Canada.
</li>
								<li><b>Comparative Advantage:</b>  the ability of one person, region, or country to provide a good or service relatively more cheaply than other countries. For example, the UK and Canada can both produce lumber and automobiles. However it would be more efficient for both if Canada produces lumber and UK produces the automobiles and then trades with each other.</li>
