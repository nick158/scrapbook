					<h1>'Great Pacific Garbage Patch' researchers devastated by sight</h1>
						<p>Far away from California's coast, where the Pacific Ocean currents swirl, the blue of the sea was replaced by fishing nets, buckets, buoys, laundry baskets and unidentifiable pieces of plastic that floated past the Ocean Star, a ship carrying a team of scientists and volunteers gathering data on plastic garbage.</p> 
<p>"We were surrounded by an endless layer of garbage," sad Serena Cunsolo, an Italian marine biologist who works for The Ocean Cleanup. "It was devastating to see."</p> 
<p>Cunsolo, 28, was one of a team of 15 researchers and volunteers aboard the Ocean Starr who a month ago set out from San Francisco to study the plastic waste as part of the "Mega Expedition," a major step in the organization's effort to eventually clean up what's known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.</p> 
						<p>The 171-foot mother ship returned on Sunday to San Francisco, carrying massive white bags filled with plastic garbage along with two sailing boats with volunteers who helped collect the garbage samples.</p>

							<h1>Summary</h1>
							<p>
							The terms which are relevant to “Chapter 1: Scarcity & Decision Making”’, are closely connected to the article on the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. The large amounts of plastic in the Garbage Patch are likely a result of <b>psychological wants</b>, the desiring of <b>goods</b> not essential to life. People demand low-cost goods to satisfy their psychological wants. The size of the Garbage Patch indicates that there is a lower <b>opportunity cost</b> for throwing away these plastic goods as compared to recycling them. The higher opportunity cost for recycling poses a sustainability issue as Earth’s <b>natural resources</b> slowly run out.

							<h1>Business Elite See Income Inequality as a Threat to Business</h1>
						<p>The income gap is concerning even those at the very top of the economic ladder, a new study shows.</p>
						<p>A recent survey of Harvard Business School alumni shows that they are overall optimistic about U.S. business performance in the global economy. </p>
						<p>In their view, barriers to entrepreneurship are lower compared to other countries and entrepreneurship is more accessible in America today than it was a decade ago, according to Harvard Business School's latest survey on U.S. competitiveness.
						</p>
						<p>Despite this sentiment, they're concerned that their businesses stand to suffer from the lack of shared prosperity in the U.S.</p>
						<p>More than 70 percent of respondents say the lack of shared prosperity is a problem for their business--not just a social issue. Two thirds of respondents consider resolving rising inequality and middle-class stagnation a higher priority than boosting overall economic growth</p>

							<h1>Summary</h1>
							<p>
							This article has a strong relationship between the concepts discussed in ‘Chapter 2: National Decision Making.’USA is mainly a <b>market economy</b>, which is founded on the principles of <b>profit</b> and innovation. Unlike a <b>command or mixed economy</b>, it is the uncoordinated actions of buyers and sellers to decide which goods and services are produced. The article’s main concern is that the income inequality caused by the market economy in the USA may be creating barriers for individuals looking to innovate and create businesses in the US economy.

					<h1>Oil patch takes aim at R&D spending to make way for more cuts</h1>
						<p>Cash-starved oil sands companies are eyeing fresh cuts to research and development budgets – a sign that today’s depressed crude prices could hamper the innovation that analysts say is needed to lower production costs in the notoriously expensive sector.</p> 
<p>Some of the industry’s biggest producers, including Cenovus Energy Inc. and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., are putting spending on technology development under the microscope even as they seek cheaper ways to wring crude from Alberta.</p> 
<p>It’s the latest indication that executives don’t expect prices to return to triple-digit levels any time soon. A Cenovus executive said Tuesday the company was now stress-testing its balance sheet against $50 (U.S.) crude to the end of 2017, hinting at more pain to come.</p> 
						<p>Companies have so far scrapped billions of dollars’ worth of expansion projects, frozen salaries, and eliminated thousands of jobs to shore up finances amid the year-long rout.</p>

							<h1>Summary</h1>
							<p>
							This article is discusses several topics which are relevant to key terms in ‘Chapter 3: Productive Resources’.The prices of the <b>natural resource</b>, resources which occur in nature, oil has dropped significantly. The drop in oil price is affecting the budget decisions of Canadian oil companies operating in the Canadian oil sands who are engaged in this <b>primary industry</b>. These companies are trying to allocate their <b>productive resources</b> so that they can outlast the downturn in oil prices, oftentimes by closing oil wells. Some companies are choosing to cut back on their R&D budget while others are choosing to cut the cost of <b>human resources</b> by laying off workers.

							<h1>Think Like Uber: How to Validate Demand and Supply Before You Build</h1>
						<p>At a $50 billion valuation, Uber is now valued higher than 80 percent of the S&P 500. With that kind of success, it's no surprise that a legion of startup minds are racing to cash in on the same approach. Who among us doesn't want to be the founder of the next Uber? We are seeing the "Uberization" of the American economy.</p>
						<p>My company, Trustify, gives consumers access to vetted, experienced private investigators with the touch of a button, in the same way that Uber puts ride-seekers in touch with drivers. I've seen what works and what doesn't in this model, especially if you're trying to disrupt an established market. Before you speak to investors, build a product or hire a team, you must first validate demand and the labor force. </p>
						<p>Uber did not invent the concept of aggregating disparate supply and demand to create a business. People have been creating marketplaces to buy and sell products and services since the Stone Age. But Uber stands out because they're loud, disruptive and lean -- leveraging cheap and accessible technology at scale</p>

							<h1>Summary</h1>
							<p>
							This article is a classic case study of how <b>supply</b> and <b>demand</b> can affect the economy. The author applies the principles of supply and demand to startup companies such as Uber, which essentially connects freelance drivers to demanding consumers. For startups looking to emulate Uber, the author cautions that these business find a niche <b>market</b> where there is both <b>inelastic demand</b> for their service and freelance suppliers to provide that service. One key point worth noting is that for many businesses trying to emulate Uber, they pick a niche which does not have enough demand. This results in a surplus of supply which ultimately results in the failure of the business.

							<h1>Bernie Sanders Explains How Taxing The Rich Will Pay For His Policies</h1>
						<p>Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is adamant that only wealthy Americans will need to pay higher taxes to fund his proposals for expanding government social programs.</p>
						<p>Bill Maher, who interviewed Sanders on HBO’s “Real Time” on Friday night, pressed Sanders on the point.
						</p>
						<p>“Now this has been studied, the amount of tax revenue we would get just from taxing the people who I think your fans think you’re talking about -- the people who own a yacht -- does not come close to covering what you want to pay for,” Maher argued.
						</p>
						<p>
						“Not true, not true,” the Democratic presidential hopeful responded.
						</p>
						<p>
						Sanders then went through the largest items on his policy agenda -- Medicare for all; free college tuition at public institutions; higher Social Security benefits; and free child care -- and explained how each of them would only require asking more of wealthy Americans.

By funding free health care, education, and better Social Security, this allows equal opportunities for American citizens who are living below the <b>L.I.C.O</b>. If implemented, such actions would benefit the economy as it would create a larger middle class with higher discretionary income to purchase goods from businesses.

							<h1>Hacking Health drives healthcare into 21st century with new accelerator</h1>
						<p>Stepping into an old Montreal hospital often feels like stepping into the 1980s.</p>
						<p>Dismal paint jobs, flickering fluorescent lights and chipped melamine everywhere, not to mention the malfunctioning take-a-number dispensers and a two-hour wait to get a blood test from a nurse — hospitals here are often the last place you’d associate the word “innovation” with.
						</p>
						<p>But Luc Sirois and his squad of Hacking Health volunteers are looking to change that perception by giving hospitals an infusion of the entrepreneurial spirit.
						</p>
						<p>
						“Someone (working at the hospital) has a new idea. Who do they go see? Whose job includes receiving a new idea as part of their job description? Today, no one,” said Sirois, the co-founder and leader of Hacking Health.
						</p>
						<p>
						“You have to help the hospital understand how to transform itself, how to go from those standard administrative processes to creating new ways for ideas to enter the hospital.”
						</p>
						<p>Montreal-born Hacking Health is trying to do just that.</p>

							<b>Entrepreneurs</b> are arguably one of the most powerful forces in the economy. Their <b>innovation</b> is what allows economies to continually grow and also creates new jobs. The article discusses the creation of an accelerator which assists health startups who are bringing innovation to healthcare: a slow moving industry. Accelerators increase a startup’s chances of success by minimizing their <b>risk</b> for failue, by giving startups <b>starting capital</b> and connecting them to a network of mentors who can give guidance and train the entrepreneurs. The starting capital is significant for these startup as insufficient start up money is one reason that businesses will fail.

							<h1>Canadians are on a big-ticket shopping spree, retail data shows</h1>
						<p>Canadian consumers continue to snap up big-ticket items such as vehicles and furniture, providing a powerful jolt to an economy desperately in need of one as other areas (like low oil prices) drag on momentum.</p>
						<p>Statistics Canada said Thursday retail sales jumped more than expected in August – the fourth month in a row sales have ticked higher, despite persistent concerns among economy watchers about the affect sliding prices for oil and other commodities will have on consumers’ pocketbooks (by way of jobs and incomes, etc.).
						</p>
						<p>“Retail sales continued their recent ascent in August,” Brian DePratto, an economist at TD Bank said. Low borrowing rates and lower gasoline prices provided “ key supports” to spending, he said, while the federal handout to families (the Universal Child Care Benefit) in late July, likely also provided some lift.
						</p>
						<p>
						Here’s five things consumers should know about the latest retail sales figures:

							<h1>Summary</h1>
							<p>
							This article discusses the continued increase in Canadian <b>consumption</b>, as indicated by Statistics Canada. One reason outlined in the article would be low interest rates, which increases the use of consumer <b>credit</b> as it becomes cheaper to use instruments such as credit cards. The concern is that this increase in consumption comes at the cost of increased <b>consumer debt</b> which negatively impacts the <b>savings</b>  of consumers. Savings are an important factor in personal finances as in the future, savings allow one to retire with enough money to get through one’s “golden years”.

							<h1>Bank of Canada: Negative rates lift bar on changing inflation target</h1>
						<p>The Bank of Canada's new estimation that it could take interest rates into negative territory if needed makes the bar even higher for changing the central bank's existing 2 percent inflation target, Governor Stephen Poloz told Reuters on Friday.</p>
						<p>The central bank and the Canadian government are due to renew the bank's five-year inflation-targeting mandate by the end of next year.
						</p>
						<p>The bank had previously estimated that it could not cut rates lower than 0.25 percent but it now believes its benchmark interest rate could go as low as minus 0.5 percent. It currently stands at 0.5 percent after two rate cuts this year.
						</p>
						<p>
						Poloz said earlier this month that current circumstances did not warrant going to negative rates but that the ability to do so gave the central bank more room for maneuver.
						</p>
						<p>
						He noted on Friday that the lower rate threshold "shifts the argument" around the inflation target.

If the Bank of Canada chose to do so, it is highly likely that through <b>moral suasion</b> other Canadian banks such as TD, BMO, and RBC would follow suite and lower their <b>prime lending rates</b>.
